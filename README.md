# The Adventures Of Moji
3D platformer procedurally generated from user input exploring how procedural generation can create delight through randomness management. Senior Thesis Project for BS in Computer Science (Yale)

## Built with Unity 5.5.6f1 
Current versions of unity no longer support Javascript so you'll minimum need a version before they dropped that support

## Docs, Details, and Other Info
This also doubled as my final project in Digital Animation, and the following (public) link has a very cheeky **trailer** I made to highlight the animations for purposes of that class: https://www.facebook.com/slevatich/videos/vb.1058477266/10210512089492676/

**Docs/FinalSubmission/Sam_Levatich_CPSC490_Final_Report.pdf** offers a more detailed look at methodology/learnings.

**Docs/FinalSubmission/README.txt** has gameplay and controls instructions for actually playing. Have fun!
