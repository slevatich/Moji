    <h1>Procedurally Generated Landscapes For Sandbox Play</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Game development, as a large commercial realm with lots of worlds to be generated, stands to benefit a lot from a smart procedure for generating different sorts of levels or landscapes to play in. But the single most important quality of a game is a simple question: is it fun? The answer to that question is, unfortunately, subjective and complicated, but principles of game design can give some answers. In this project, I created "The Adventures of Moji in the Land of Semi-Random Quilts," a cheekily titled proof of concept game in the Unity game engine with a variety of procedurally generated and placed elements that contribute toward player enjoyment. The game puts players in control of Moji, who interacts with the generated landscape through running, jumping, and grappling upward, and aims to collect all the rewards strewn throughout the game world. Runtime generated challenges such as climbing an ever taller series of columns, hopping from platform to platform over dangerous lava, and hunting for rewards within player created geometry provide a sense of danger, accomplishment, and fun, while indirect modes of enjoyment like character emotions and a full fledged selfie mode provide alternate ways to have a pleasant gaming experience. Because it is procedurally generated based on an initial map drawn by the user, no playthrough is the same and it offers high replayability even in proof of concept state. Player enjoyment was measured through qualitative user feedback, gathered during testing at multiple points during the development process.
