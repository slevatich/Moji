Welcome to The Adventures of Moji in Semi Random Quilt Land! This explains how to play

On launching the game, you are presented with a mostly green canvas: you can draw on this to make the game map!

Press r,g,and b to switch between brush colors (green functions as an eraser). Red is mountain reigions, blue is drained lakes, and green is grass. Make sure to leave enough grass for exciting features to spawn!

When you are done drawing, press p to play. A controller is strongly recomended for actual gameplay, and those controls are described below. Have fun! If you are not using an xbox controller, you can find the joystick buttons and keyboard variants of all the actions below in the input menu that appears on launching the game
